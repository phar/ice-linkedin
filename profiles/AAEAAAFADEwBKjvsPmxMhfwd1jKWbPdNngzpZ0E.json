I excel at providing pragmatic legal guidance and results-oriented solutions.\n\nI've had several professional lives already.  I was a business and operations analyst for a rapidly growing manufacturing startup, where I oversaw purchasing, managed millions of dollars of inventory, drafted shareholder reports, and helped design print advertisements.  Later, it was a privilege to cover technology, science, and telecommunications issues as a legislative staffer for a member of the U.S. House of Representatives. \n\nI started my legal career as part of an honors program in the general counsel's office of a major federal agency.  In the years since, I've drafted and advised clients on complex transactions and agreements, helped license intellectual property, become familiar with many kinds of civil litigation (including extensive e-discovery work), torts, privacy, government contract formation and litigation, and administrative law.  I've had some exposure to cyber law, constitutional law, customs law, regulatory work, employment law, and immigration law, and have conducted legal research on all of the above.  My clients have included presidential appointees, doctors, senior civil servants, graphic designers, and undercover law enforcement agents.  I've presented at government contracts-community conferences on sole-source procurements and limited competition justifications.\n\nI love a challenge, enjoy mastering new skill sets and environments, and I thrive on working as part of a team.", "pendingInvitation": false, "defaultPosition": {"posId": 141692304, "new": false, "current": true, "companyName": "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)", "description": "\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 General law experience in the general counsel's office for the second largest law enforcement agency in the United States.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Advise on the formation and defense of complex contracts, including hardware and software acquisitions and intellectual property licensing.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Defend and provide litigation support for more than twenty civil tort and injunctive lawsuits filed in U.S. district courts across the country.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Responsible for designing, implementing, and maintaining e-discovery policies and procedures for an agency with 20,000 employees in hundreds of separate offices.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Primary legal counsel for medical and operational liability questions.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Supervise paralegals engaged in administrative claim processing and adjudication.", "location": "Washington D.C.
