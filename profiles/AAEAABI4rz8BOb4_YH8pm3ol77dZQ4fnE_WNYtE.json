The longitudinal analysis identified how these relationships develop and change through adolescence. Using data from the Mobile Youth Survey, a 14-year longitudinal study of high-poverty, primarily Black American youths living in Alabama (N = 5400), delinquency, self-worth, and peer influence were analyzed in linear growth models. Results from these three linear growth models are presented. Findings include a significant increase in delinquency over time for the adolescents in the study and significantly lower rates of delinquency overall for females than males. Delinquency was also found to have negative relationships to both parental warmth and self-worth, with higher levels leading to decreased delinquency. Peer influence was found to have a gender effect, with males exhibiting steady rates, while females exhibit an increase in peer influence over time. Furthermore, maternal warmth and self-worth are also found to increase the rates of peer influence as well as significantly increasing self-worth.", "location": "Mobile, Alabama", "title": "Mobile Youth Survey (MYS) Public Health Research Intern", "startedOn": {"month": 4, "year": 2008}, "companyUrn": "urn:li:fs_salesCompany:166552"}], "pictureInfo": {}, "relatedColleagueCompanyId": 533534, "savedLead": false, "firstName": "Vantreese", "numOfSharedConnections": 0, "memberBadges": {"premium": true, "openLink": true, "jobSeeker": false}, "flagshipProfileUrl": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/vantreese-collins-hodges", "location": "Washington D.C.
