Following graduation, I began an exciting career in federal law enforcement which ultimately brought me to Loudoun County. I quickly fell in love with the area and in 2007 I decided to become a licensed realtor in hope of helping others discover all that Northern Virginia has to offer.\n\nWorking with both buyers and sellers, I enjoy the human side of real estate and pride myself on my ability to build rapport and develop great working relationships with clients through active listening skills and empathy. More importantly, I am able to maintain these relationships because of my enhanced level of commitment, consistency, and integrity which has resulted in my designation as a top producer among Pearson Smith Realty\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 725+ agents.\n\nIn my spare time, I love spending quality time with my husband, daughter and our Old English Sheepdog. We can often be found hanging out at home entertaining our friends and family \u00e2\u0080\u0093 especially during college football season and warm summer nights. We also enjoy traveling both domestically and internationally \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it is always fun discovering new places and cultures!!\n\nIn addition, I am honored to serve on the Board of Directors for the Loudoun First Responders Foundation. LFRF is a nonprofit organization that provides immediate financial support to our local heroes in need. I find it incredibly rewarding to give back and consider it a privilege to help those who sacrifice so much for the good of Loudoun County.\n\nLike my husband and several other people close to our hearts, many of my clients are current or retired law enforcement, fire, and military personnel. If you happen to serve in any one of these capacities, please ask me about my \u00e2\u0080\u009cPay It Forward\u00e2\u0080\u009d program.\n", "pendingInvitation": false, "defaultPosition": {"posId": 420391636, "new": false, "current": true, "companyName": "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)", "title": "Analyst", "startedOn": {"month": 3, "year": 2010}, "companyUrn": "urn:li:fs_salesCompany:533534"}, "degree": -1, "fullName": "", "positions": [{"posId": 420391636, "new": false, "current": true, "companyName": "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)", "title": "Analyst", "startedOn": {"month": 3, "year": 2010}, "companyUrn": "urn:li:fs_salesCompany:533534"}, {"posId": 420396975, "new": false, "current": true, "companyName": "Pearson Smith Realty", "location": "Northern Virginia", "title": "Real Estate Agent", "startedOn": {"month": 1, "year": 2008}, "companyUrn": "urn:li:fs_salesCompany:9209178"}, {"posId": 666272542, "current": false, "endedOn": {"year": 2006}, "companyName": "FAMS", "title": "Analyst", "startedOn": {"year": 2004}}], "pictureInfo": {}, "relatedColleagueCompanyId": 533534, "savedLead": false, "numOfSharedConnections": 0, "memberBadges": {"premium": false, "openLink": false, "jobSeeker": false}, "flagshipProfileUrl": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/debra-holborow-williams-b2024867", "location": "Washington D.C.
