I spent two years on the front line of America's Border Security apparatus, apprehending people attempting to illegally or improperly enter the United States, and interdicting drugs, agricultural pests, and other harmful items as they crossed the border.\n\nI was then afforded the opportunity to serve in a different role in our wide reaching mission to secure America's Homeland. I moved back across the country to northern Vermont and came on board with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. I incorporated my experience on the border into my new role with the Targeting Operations Division within ICE/Enforcement and Removal Operations. Serving in the Communications Section, I responded to various requests from law enforcement agencies inquiring into a subject's immigration status in the United States and referring criminal aliens or subjects of concern to immigration authorities. Concurrently, as an ICE Headquarters component, I was involved in various aspects of ICE cases and policy development.\n\nAs of February 2017, I accepted an opportunity to return to the field and actively engage in law enforcement operations.
