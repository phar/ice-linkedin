During my military service, I worked under two very distinctive careers. I began my journey as a Security Specialist protecting high-value military assets (people, buildings, and aircraft). After three years, I changed careers to the Manpower and Organization community and performed as a Manpower Analyst/Consultant for the remainder of my time in service. During this time, I advised senior officials on how to use military positions effectively and efficiently. I used Industrial Engineering methods and techniques to complete projects and performed studies to consult on and manage positions assigned to a military installation.   I currently work as a Sr. Management and Program Analyst within a Systems Management Unit, and I am assigned as the Project Manager for two web-based applications. I am appointed as a Contracting Officer's Representative responsible for overseeing and monitoring six contracts with a life-cycle value of $35 million. I formerly was a Team Lead who led two teams of personnel who were accountable for validating user requests for access to a major system and for maintaining and monitoring the day-to-day security operations of those applications by assessing and evaluating the security controls implemented by the Information Systems Security Program.", "pendingInvitation": false, "defaultPosition": {"posId": 831187783, "new": false, "current": true, "companyName": "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)", "title": "Sr Management & Program Analyst/Project Manager", "startedOn": {"month": 10, "year": 2015}, "companyUrn": "urn:li:fs_salesCompany:533534"}, "degree": -1, "fullName": "", "positions": [{"posId": 831187783, "new": false, "current": true, "companyName": "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)", "title": "Sr Management & Program Analyst/Project Manager", "startedOn": {"month": 10, "year": 2015}, "companyUrn": "urn:li:fs_salesCompany:533534"}, {"posId": 383999739, "new": false, "current": false, "endedOn": {"month": 10, "year": 2015}, "companyName": "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)", "title": "Sr. Management & Program Analyst/Team Lead", "startedOn": {"month": 10, "year": 2007}, "companyUrn": "urn:li:fs_salesCompany:533534"}, {"posId": 384000529, "new": false, "current": false, "endedOn": {"month": 5, "year": 2007}, "companyName": "United States Air Force", "description": " Previous locations assigned: Minot AFB, ND; Okinawa AB, Japan; Ramstein AB, Germany; Dover AFB, DE; and Incirlik AB, Turkey", "location": "Fort Meade, MD", "title": "Sr. Manpower Analyst", "startedOn": {"month": 4, "year": 1988}, "companyUrn": "urn:li:fs_salesCompany:157235"}, {"posId": 677304029, "new": false, "current": false, "endedOn": {"month": 3, "year": 1988}, "companyName": "United States Air Force", "location": "Lackland AFB, TX; Hickam AFB, HI;  & Minot AFB, ND", "title": "Security Specialist", "startedOn": {"month": 11, "year": 1984}, "companyUrn": "urn:li:fs_salesCompany:157235"}], "pictureInfo": {}, "relatedColleagueCompanyId": 533534, "savedLead": false, "numOfSharedConnections": 0, "memberBadges": {"premium": false, "openLink": false, "jobSeeker": false}, "flagshipProfileUrl": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-rochester-91925a6a", "location": "Washington D.C.
