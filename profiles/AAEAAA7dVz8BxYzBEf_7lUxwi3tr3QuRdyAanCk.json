I put my natural curiosity and research ability to use as an intelligence officer, answering complex questions for senior military leaders. As a police officer, my desire to serve and steady nature helped me bring calm and craft solutions during stressful situations. Now, I want to continue to hone my gifts to become a better professional. Still, more, I want to grow as an individual.\n\nMy desire to serve others has grown and is rooted in a strong Christian faith. My profession has provided for me to pursue my passion; the study and teaching of the Bible and the Christian faith. After six years of balancing work, family, and study, I completed a Master of Divinity degree at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary. Now, it is my hope to encourage others with the good news of the Christian faith.
